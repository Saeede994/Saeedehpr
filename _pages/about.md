Hi There! &#x1F44B; I'm Saeede. I'm a PhD student at the University of Toronto, where I spend most of my time exploring the exciting intersection of machine learning and engineering.
I’m passionate about research and development, especially when it involves solving real-world problems.
Whether it’s diving deep into code or tackling tough challenges, I’m all about pushing boundaries and finding innovative solutions. 
When I’m not working on my research, I’m often thinking about how machine learning can streamline everyday tasks—because, let’s be honest, who doesn’t appreciate a little efficiency? &#x1F609;
