Hi There! &#x1F44B; I'm Saeede. I'm a PhD student at the University of Toronto, where I spend most of my time exploring the exciting intersection of machine learning and engineering.
I’m passionate about research and development, especially when it involves solving real-world problems.

My PhD research focuses on developing a physics-informed machine learning model to predict flow fields in wind farms. This model will serve as a surrogate to accelerate the wind farm layout optimization process.
 
Outside of my academic life, I enjoy playing and watching soccer, hiking, and capturing the beauty of nature through my camera lens &#x1F4F7; As an amateur photographer, I’m always looking for the perfect shot! &#x1F609;
