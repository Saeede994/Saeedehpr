Hi There! &#x1F44B; I'm Saeede. I'm a PhD student at the University of Toronto, where I spend most of my time exploring the exciting intersection of machine learning and engineering.
I’m passionate about research and development, especially when it involves solving real-world problems.
Whether it’s diving deep into code or tackling tough challenges, I’m all about pushing boundaries and finding innovative solutions. 
When I’m not in the lab or behind a computer, I’m probably daydreaming about how ML can make life easier because let’s be honest, why do it manually when a machine can do it for you?
